Prerequisites:
C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Common options include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang.
Boost Libraries: Install the Boost libraries, specifically the multiprecision library. You can download them from the official Boost website (https://www.boost.org/) or use your package manager (e.g., apt on Ubuntu, brew on macOS).
Steps:
Create a New C++ File:

Open a text editor or your preferred IDE.
Create a new C++ file with a .cpp extension (e.g., shamir_secret_sharing.cpp).
Copy the Code:

Copy the provided C++ code into the newly created file.
Include Necessary Headers:

At the beginning of the code, include the necessary headers:
C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <boost/multiprecision/cpp_int.hpp>
Use code with caution.

Compile the Code:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the C++ file.
Use your C++ compiler to compile the code. For example, if you're using GCC:
Bash
g++ -std=c++11 shamir_secret_sharing.cpp -o shamir_secret_sharing
Use code with caution.

This will create an executable file named shamir_secret_sharing.
Run the Code:

Execute the executable file:
Bash
./shamir_secret_sharing
Use code with caution.

The output will display the constant term (secret) calculated from the provided test case.
Additional Notes:
Replace the Sample Test Case: If you want to use a different test case, replace the sample JSON data in the main function with your desired data.
Error Handling: Consider adding error handling to check for invalid input or potential exceptions during calculations.
Efficiency: For very large numbers or performance-critical applications, explore optimization techniques like using more efficient algorithms or data structures.
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run the code and calculate the constant term for your desired test cases.
